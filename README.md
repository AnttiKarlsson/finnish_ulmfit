Pretrained ulmfit for Finnish and a classification example
This repository contains a pretrained UlmFit model + an example notebook for using the model to create a classifier on text data (the data is in Finnish).

Training the model has been made possible by the work at Auria Biobank, located in the Turku University hospital and jointly owned by the hospital district of southwest Finland, hospital districts of Satakunta and Vaasa and the University of Turku.
